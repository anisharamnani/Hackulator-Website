Avi later saw that students in under resourced schools didn't have access to graphing calculators; they were locked up and only available for short segments of classroom time.

				<td> Anisha Ramnani thinks math is awesome and wants people to love math.  She feels too many students are overwhelmed by the fact that math builds on previously learned material over the years and doesn't want it to be that way. She’s going to make sure this calculator helps people be less scared of math. </td>
